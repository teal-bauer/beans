Add inherited/effective status that propagates terminal statuses (scrapped, completed) from parent beans to children transitively. Children keep their explicit status unchanged, but expose an inherited status for display and filtering purposes.

## Summary of Changes

Implemented inherited status: Core.InheritedStatus(), GraphQL fields, ready filter exclusion, list/show/TUI display with ↑status annotation
