Several frontend components read localStorage without validating the stored values. SplitPane.svelte line 37 does parseInt() which can return NaN. Layout.ts reads view preferences without checking they match expected values. If localStorage is tampered with (or corrupted), the app could malfunction. Fix: (1) SplitPane: clamp parsed value between MIN_SIZE and MAX_SIZE, fallback to default on NaN. (2) Layout.ts: validate view value is one of the expected enum values ('backlog', 'board', etc.) before using it. (3) Any other localStorage reads should have similar guards. Low priority since this requires existing XSS or physical access to exploit.

## Summary of Changes

- SplitPane.svelte: Added Number.isNaN() guard on parseInt result when loading persisted split size from localStorage. Falls back to initialSize default instead of producing NaN.
- +layout.ts: Changed nullish coalescing (??) to logical OR (||) for activeView localStorage read, so empty strings also fall back to 'planning'.
- planningView and showPlanningChat reads were already safe (explicit value checks). filterText is free-form and needs no validation.
