Add `beans scrap <id> --reason <text>` command.

## Behavior

- Sets status to `scrapped`
- **Required** `--reason` flag to document why the bean was scrapped
- Adds a `## Reason for Scrapping` section to the bean body (preserves project memory)
- Shows confirmation message

## Example

```bash
beans scrap beans-abc --reason "Superseded by beans-xyz approach"
```
